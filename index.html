        <p class="justify-normal pt-4 pb-6 px-6">Born July 6th, 1949 in Punjab, India, Balbir Singh Sodhi was a member of the Sikh religion, as well as a husband and a father to 3 sons and 2 daughters. In 1989, he immigrated to the United States, initially settling down in Los Angeles, where he worked as a computer engineer at HP. Eventually, Sodhi was able to save up enough money to buy a gas station as well as several affiliated franchises in Phoenix, Arizona, and moved there. He would come to be known amongst the community he settled in as a generous and kind man. However, on September 15th, 2001, four days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 42-year-old Frank Silva Roque racially profiled Sodhi as an Arab Muslim due to his clothes, his turban, and his beard, and subsequently shot him 5 times with a .380 caliber handgun, killing him. Prior to this, Roque had reportedly been ranting about immigrants at a sports bar in Mesa, where he apparently wanted revenge for the 9/11 attacks. Following the shooting, Roque was reported to have boasted about his actions at a local bar, saying “They’re investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street.” Sodhi’s murder was one of many hostile incidents in the Phoenix area targeted at Sikhs in the days succeeding the 9/11 attacks, and in these days Sikhs had difficulties going to work due to the rise in overt harassment towards them. The day after Sodhi’s murder, Roque was caught and arrested, and his bail was set at 1 million dollars. His trial by jury began on August 18th, 2003, where his attorneys argued he was not guilty due to insanity, as well as that Roque had a diminished IQ and heard voices saying that Arabs must be killed. On September 30th, 2003, Roque was found guilty of first degree murder, and was sentenced to death (later commuted to life in prison). </p>
