        <p class="text-center text-sm p-4">The "Cabinet of Curiosities" project is dedicated to uncovering stories of those whose narratives have been overshadowed, neglected, or forgotten by the larger public. Through this project, we hope to bring light to these hidden histories, both national and local, and emphasize the importance of remembrance and awareness. 

            Inspired by the life and tragic death of Balbir Singh Sodhi, our installation highlights not only his story but also the many untold stories of individuals who have suffered from prejudice, violence, and injustice. By symbolically completing the gestures that were left unfinished — such as planting the flowers that Balbir never could — we aim to honor their legacies and remind viewers that these stories are not isolated incidents, but are woven into the fabric of modern society. 
            
            Our hope is that, through these objects and narratives, viewers will be encouraged to reflect on the consequences of hatred and indifference, and consider how they can contribute to a world where such tragedies are acknowledged and remembered, and where the seeds of understanding and empathy can take root.</p>

                <p class="text-center p-4 font-medium text-sm">Flower- On November 15th, 2001, just four days after 9/11, Balbir Singh Sodhi was outside his family-owned and operated gas station, planting flowers for the victims of 9/11. Moments later, he was shot dead in an Islamaphobic attack, and the flowers he meant to have planted never reached the soil. Our group decided to honor Balbir and the victims of 9/11 by planting the flowers he never got to. Hence, the flower provides a message to the viewer of what could have been. </p>

                <p class="text-center p-4 font-medium text-sm">News Paper- Newspapers tell stories of local and national events; they cover almost anything from town parades to celebrity sightings. Newspapers do more than say to the news; they also tell stories and spread information. But Balbir’s murder never made the news until 16 years after his death, and because of this, we felt it was essential to show how his death should have been presented. We believe that instead of censorship, horrific attacks based on hatred should be known by the public to spread awareness. We want people to understand that these injustices are prevalent and not a thing of the past.</p>
