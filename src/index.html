        <h2 class="text-center text-xl font-semibold p-8">A Nation in Mourning</h2>
        <p class="text-center px-8 pt-4 pb-8">The attacks on September 11, 2001, profoundly shocked the United States and the world. The immediate reactions were a mixture of grief, fear, and an overwhelming sense of loss. People from all walks of life came together to mourn the nearly 3,000 lives lost in the attacks. Vigils, memorial services, and moments of silence were held across the nation, symbolizing a collective sense of sorrow and solidarity. The haunting images of the Twin Towers collapsing, the Pentagon in flames, and the wreckage in Pennsylvania were seared into the national consciousness, serving as stark reminders of the day's horrors. Amidst the mourning, there was also a powerful display of resilience and unity. Communities rallied to support the victims' families, first responders were hailed as heroes, and a renewed sense of patriotism emerged. This period was marked by a profound emotional intensity, as Americans grappled with the tragedy and sought to find strength in unity.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center text-xl font-semibold p-8">The Rising Tide of Xenophobia</h2>
        <p class="text-center py-4 px-8">In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the United States experienced a troubling rise in xenophobia and hate crimes. Fueled by fear and anger, many Americans began to view those who appeared to be Middle Eastern, South Asian, or Muslim with suspicion and hostility. This wave of prejudice led to numerous incidents of verbal harassment, physical assaults, and even murder. Sikh Americans, often mistaken for Muslims due to their turbans and beards, were particularly targeted. The FBI reported a dramatic increase in hate crimes against Muslims, from 28 incidents in 2000 to 481 in 2001, illustrating the severe spike in anti-Muslim sentiment. This period highlighted the dangerous consequences of conflating terrorism with an entire religion or ethnic group. The case of Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh man murdered in Arizona, became a tragic symbol of this misguided backlash. His death underscored the need for greater awareness, education, and efforts to combat hate and promote understanding in a nation struggling to heal from its wounds.</p>

        <p class="text-center py-4 px-8">Balbir Singh Sodhi's tragic death had far-reaching consequences. His murder highlighted the urgent need to address xenophobia and educate the public about Sikhism and other minority religions. In response, advocacy groups such as the Sikh Coalition emerged to combat hate and promote tolerance. Over the years, his story has been used in educational campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of prejudice and the importance of cultural understanding. Sodhi's legacy serves as a powerful reminder of the impact of hate crimes and the necessity of continued efforts to foster inclusivity and respect for diversity.</p>
